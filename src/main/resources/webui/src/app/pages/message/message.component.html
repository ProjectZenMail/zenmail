    <p>
      Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called up coarsely:</p>

    <p> – Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</p>

    <p> Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the
      tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.</p>

    <p> Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling
      in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus,</p>

    <p> displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
      gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and</p>

    <p> at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</p>

    <p> Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.</p>

    <p> – Back to barracks! he said sternly.</p>

    <p> He added in a preacher’s tone:</p>

    <p> – For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music,
      please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little</p>

    <p> trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</p>

    <p> He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his
      even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.</p>

    <p> Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</p>

    <p> – Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?</p>

    <p> He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds
      of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl</p>

    <p> recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</p>

    <p> – The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</p>

    <p> He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen
      Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down</p>

    <p> on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush
      in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</p>

    <p> Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.</p>

    <p> – My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping
      and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens.</p>
